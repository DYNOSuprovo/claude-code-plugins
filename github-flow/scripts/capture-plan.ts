 * PreToolUse, not PostToolUse: the plan dialog's "Yes, clear context" options
 * resolve ExitPlanMode as a denial (CLI 2.1.270), and PostToolUse only runs
 * after a tool succeeds, so a plan approved that way would never be captured.
 * The cost is a file written for a plan the user then rejects, overwritten by
 * the next approval in that session.
